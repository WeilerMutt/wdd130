      <p>
        My name is Didier, I am super excited to be learning all the skills
        necessary to become a programmer. I have a ton of experience with
        administrative positions. My personal hobbies include hiking, boxing and
        cycling especially with my partner Rita💕. I love animals, I currently
        have 5 dogs, a cat, a snake and a turtle.

      <p>
        Guatemala, the northernmost Central American country, just south of
        Mexico, is home to volcanoes, rainforests and ancient Mayan sites. It is
        a producer of some of the finest coffee in the world. It is know as the
        land of the eternal spring.
